## Building

## How to use
* Tokens required for minsida/kontaktapi insert in index.js 
        endURL = 'app_token=[Insert_token]&app_secret=[insert_secret_key]';
* Restapp is required for config to access minsida/kontaktapi, https://github.com/malmostad/REST-App-Kontaktruta
* If the restapp changes name, config.js needs to reflect this by updating the variable `api` url
* For local development (use variable `local = true` in index.js and config.js)
* For reCaptcha to work the webapp needs: 
    * Accesss to this script `<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>`
    * An account at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/, if you have reCatchpa through SiteVision you should already have an account. You need to register your domain.
    * The contact.js file needs to have your reCatchpa siteKey added in it's state
    * The mailModule.js, in module/server need to have the recatchpa private-key set in var `reCatchpaKey`

## TODO
* Adding mailtemplate and extend mail functionality
* Stadsomr√•den
* If invalid recatchpa, reset the catchpa in client. Add recatchpa key in config part.
* Meta-inheritence
